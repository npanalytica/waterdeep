You can’t be located by any divination magic, but a <i>wish</i> spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p><p><i>Euryale.</i> The card’s medusa-like visage curses you.

The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</p><p><i>Moon.</i> You are granted the ability to cast the <i>wish</i> spell 1d3 times.</p><p><i>Rogue.</i> A nonplayer character of the GM’s choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a <i>wish</i> spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.</p><p><i>Ruin.</i> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p><p><i>Skull.</i> You summon an avatar of death—a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM’s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death.

One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p><p>As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p><p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</p><p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p><p>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.

The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.</p><p><i>Random Properties.</i> An <i>Orb of Dragonkind</i> has the following random properties:</p><ul><li>2 minor beneficial properties</li><li>1 minor detrimental property</li><li>1 major detrimental property</li></ul><p><i>Spells.</i> The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.</p><p><i>Destroying an Orb.</i> An <i>Orb of Dragonkind</i> appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons.
